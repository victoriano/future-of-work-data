GENERAL USAGE NOTES

This compressed folder contains the European tasks database at EU15 level, in csv file format. 

The construction of the database is presented and discussed in the working paper
 “A comprehensive European database of tasks indices for socio-economic research” published on the LET JRC series 2021/04 and jointly prepared by JRC and Eurofound (available at https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/sites/jrcsh/files/jrc124124.pdf).

The normalised scores (0-1) for all tasks indices are calculated at the job level, intended as a combination of economic sectors (Nace rev.2 two-digit) and occupations (Isco08 two-digit).
